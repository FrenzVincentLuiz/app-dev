**Hello sir Carl, I can see you lol**

*I just want to let you know that I don't have a favorite movie since I don't watch movies all that much*

| My favorite show | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Mao Mao🐈‍⬛: Heroes of Pure Heart | This high-octane animated series from creator Parker Simmons follows the adventures of Sheriff Mao Mao😼, a samurai cat with a hankering for derring-do who becomes waylaid in Pure Heart Valley along with his slacker best friend, Badgerclops. Led by King Snugglemagne, the Sweety Pies of Pure Heart are cute and cuddly, but otherwise pretty much helpless. Luckily, the residents have the heroic Mao Mao, oafish Badgerclops, and new adorable sidekick Adorabat to protect them from monsters, villains and all kinds of bad stuff. |
| The Masterful Cat is Deppressed Again🐈‍⬛ | The young employee Saku lives alone with her cat Yukichi😼, a feline as big as it is special. Yukichi is in fact extraordinarily intelligent, doing his utmost to take care of the house and of his mistress, who on the contrary is far from conscientious and has a habit of neglecting herself and her house. |
| Sacrificial Princess and the King of Beasts🐺 | The King of the Beasts and Demons regularly receives female human sacrifices to eat in order to assert the dominance of his people over the human race. However, for the 99th sacrifice, the human girl brought to the capital, Sariphi, intrigues the Beast King. In fact she isn't afraid of him or any other beast and even accepts her death without begging or crying as she has neither home nor family to return to if she were released. The King🐺 finds her intriguing and let her stay at his side as his consort despite being human. This is the story of how Sariphi will become the queen of the demons and beasts. |

	Here's a chicken sandwhich for you sir Carl🍔 [^1]
